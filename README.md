# frq (fairquark) miner

Finally committing this to my git account, had this working for over a year and needed to redo my VM's. This script assumes a few things before you can execute it.

* Download the fairquark.wallet.tgz from the fairquark site
* unpack the archive
* execute this script (as root).
